## [Project 1 :- Amazon Review Scrapping and Emotion Mining](https://github.com/AtharvaKulkarni26/Amazon-Review-Scrapping-and-Emotion-Mining)
Amazon product reviews scrapping and emotion mining.
Reviews are an important part of buying products. When buying something the consumer looks at the ratings and reviews of the product. This project focuses on the reviews of a product on Amazon. GODS Ghost 22 Litre Anti-Theft 15.6 Inch Laptop Backpack (Carbon Fibre Colour)
By using python libraries we rate the emotions of the reviews in positive and negative categories.

Technologies used - Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, URL.Lib, Beautiful Soup.

## [Project 4 :- Elon Musk Twitter Emotion Mining Project](https://github.com/AtharvaKulkarni26/Elon-Musk-Twitter-Emotion-Mining-Project)
emotion mining code on tweets of Elon Musk.
 
 Emotion Mining 
Emotion mining is the science of detecting, analyzing, and evaluating humans’ feelings towards different events, issues, services, or any other interest. One of its speciﬁc directions is text emotion mining, that refers to analyzing people’s emotions based on observations of their writings.

This small project analyses the tweets of Elon Musk combined together in a dataset using technologies like re, matplotlib, pandas and textblob.

## [Project 6 - Covid-19 Analysis in R](https://github.com/AtharvaKulkarni26/Covid-19-Analysis-in-R)
Analysis of Covid-19 with R.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

This project compares the effect of Covid-19 on the basis of age and Gender with the help of Hmisc library and the t-test in R studio.

Technologies used - R, R Studio, Hmisc Library.
